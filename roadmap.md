Project Vision: The Unified AI Agent
The core of this enhanced platform is the Agent Definition JSON. Instead of scattering configuration across different systems, every aspect of an agent—its personality, tools, data schemas, and automated tasks—will be defined in a single, comprehensive JSON document stored in MongoDB. This makes agents portable, easy to manage, and simple to create or modify through a master UI.

A Master Agent will provide a user-friendly interface for non-developers to build, configure, and deploy new AI agents by simply editing these JSON files.

Core Concept: The Agent Definition JSON
Before we begin, let's define the structure of our central configuration file. Every agent in the system will have a corresponding document in a agents collection in MongoDB that looks something like this:

{
  "agentId": "unique_agent_identifier",
  "agentName": "Dietitian Pro",
  "version": "1.0",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert dietitian providing personalized advice. Always be encouraging and base your recommendations on the user's provided data.",
  "dataSchema": {
    "collectionName": "dietitian_user_data",
    "schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "measurements": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "date": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
              "weight_kg": { "type": "number" },
              "body_fat_percentage": { "type": "number" }
            }
          }
        },
        "dietary_goals": { "type": "string" }
      }
    }
  },
  "tools": [
    {
      "toolId": "recipe_api",
      "type": "API",
      "name": "fetch_recipes",
      "description": "Fetches recipes based on ingredients or dietary restrictions.",
      "endpoint": "https://api.edamam.com/search",
      "auth": { "type": "apiKey", "key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" }
    },
    {
      "toolId": "health_news_rss",
      "type": "RSS",
      "name": "get_latest_health_news",
      "description": "Fetches the latest articles from a health and wellness blog.",
      "url": "https://somehealthblog.com/rss"
    }
  ],
  "workflows": [
    {
      "workflowId": "weekly_checkin",
      "description": "A multi-step process for the user's weekly check-in.",
      "trigger": "user_message_contains_checkin",
      "nodes": [
        { "nodeId": "1", "type": "llm_prompt", "prompt": "Ask the user for their latest weight and body fat percentage.", "output_variable": "latest_metrics" },
        { "nodeId": "2", "type": "data_store", "action": "append", "collection": "measurements", "data": "$latest_metrics" },
        { "nodeId": "3", "type": "llm_prompt", "prompt": "Analyze the new data in context of past measurements and provide feedback and encouragement.", "output_variable": "feedback" },
        { "nodeId": "4", "type": "send_response", "message": "$feedback" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "schedules": [
    {
      "scheduleId": "monday_motivation",
      "cron": "0 9 * * 1",
      "description": "Send a motivational message every Monday morning.",
      "workflowId": "send_motivational_quote_workflow" 
    }
  ]
}

Phase 1: The Core Engine & Master Agent (Weeks 1-5)
This phase is about building the foundation to manage and interpret the agent JSONs.

1.1. Backend Setup (FastAPI & MongoDB):

Set up a FastAPI project with Motor for asynchronous MongoDB access.

Create the primary MongoDB collection: agents.

1.2. Master Agent API:

Develop a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints in FastAPI for the agents collection.

These endpoints will be the backbone of the Master Agent, allowing for programmatic creation and modification of agent definitions.

1.3. Master Agent UI (Initial Version):

Create a simple web-based UI (using HTML/JavaScript or a framework like React).

The UI will have a form that dynamically renders fields based on the Agent Definition JSON schema.

A user should be able to:

View a list of existing agents.

Click "Create New Agent" to open a blank form.

Fill out the system prompt, data schema details, tool configurations, etc.

Save the new agent, which calls the Master Agent API to store the JSON in MongoDB.

1.4. Agent Runtime Loader:

Create the core Python logic that, given an agentId, fetches its corresponding JSON document from MongoDB and loads it into a usable configuration object for the backend.

Phase 2: Agent Execution & Dynamic Tooling (Weeks 6-9)
Now we make the agents functional by interpreting their configuration at runtime.

2.1. Basic Chat Endpoint:

Create a main chat endpoint /chat/{agentId}.

When a user sends a message to this endpoint, the system uses the Agent Runtime Loader (from 1.4) to get the agent's configuration.

It then initializes an LLM instance with the systemPrompt from the JSON.

2.2. Dynamic Data Handling:

Implement logic that reads the dataSchema from the agent's JSON.

When an agent needs to store or retrieve user-specific information, it will use the collectionName defined in its schema to interact with the correct MongoDB collection. This ensures a dietitian agent doesn't accidentally access a real estate agent's data.

2.3. Tool Execution Engine:

Build a Python module that can parse the tools array in the agent JSON.

For each tool, it will dynamically create a function that the LLM can call.

For "type": "API", it will construct and execute the API request, handling authentication.

For "type": "RSS", it will use a library like feedparser to fetch and return the content.

Integrate this with your LLM interaction library (e.g., LangChain's custom tools).

Phase 3: The Workflow Engine (Weeks 10-14)
This is the most innovative part of the project.

3.1. Workflow JSON Schema:

Finalize the JSON structure for the workflows and nodes. Define various node types:

llm_prompt: A call to the LLM.

data_store: Read/write/update data in the user's specific collection.

tool_call: Execute one of the agent's defined tools.

conditional_logic: Branch the workflow based on an output (e.g., if x > 10, go to node 5, else go to node 6).

send_response: Send a message back to the user.

3.2. Workflow Executor:

Write the core Python class/module that acts as the workflow interpreter.

It will take a workflowId and a starting context (e.g., the user's message).

It will step through the nodes in sequence, executing the action for each node and passing the output of one node as input to the next.

3.3. Trigger Mechanism:

Implement the logic that initiates a workflow. This could be based on a user's message content (as defined in the trigger field) or an internal event.

Phase 4: Scheduling & Deployment (Weeks 15-18)
This phase makes agents proactive and gets the platform ready for production.

4.1. Scheduler Integration:

Integrate a scheduling library like APScheduler (simpler, good for in-process scheduling) or Celery (more robust, for distributed tasks).

Create a startup process that reads the schedules array from all agent JSONs and registers the jobs with the scheduler.

When a scheduled job runs, it will trigger the specified workflowId using the Workflow Executor.

4.2. Security and Scalability:

Harden all API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.

Containerize the application (FastAPI, UI, scheduler) using Docker.

4.3. Deployment:

Deploy the containerized application to a cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS Fargate).

Set up your production MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring.

By following this revised roadmap, you will create a highly modular, scalable, and user-empowering AI platform where the creation of sophisticated, autonomous agents is as simple as filling out a form.
